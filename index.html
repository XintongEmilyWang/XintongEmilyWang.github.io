        <!-- <h2 class="title">About Me</h2> -->
        <p><!-- Hi! I'm Xintong Wang (my name in Chinese: <span style="font-family:STKaiti; font-size:12pt"> 王欣曈</span>).  --> 
        I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/"> Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> (starting in January 2024).
        My research interests lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and economics.
        My recent work focuses on multi-agent, game-theoretic environments where agents interact, often with the aid of algorithms, and agents' desires may not easily and reliably match up. 
        Examples include online platforms, financial markets, rush-hour commutes, poker games.
        </p>

        <p>
        I think about principled ways to integrate computational tools (e.g., machine learning, simulation techniques) and economic reasoning (e.g., game theory) to study two broad categories of problems:<br> 
        (i) understanding agent incentives and behavior to design systems that can attain socially optimal outcomes from agent interactions; <br> 
        (ii) addressing computational challenges that arise when operating or analyzing multi-agent systems.<br>
        My work finds applications to economic platforms, recommender systems, financial markets (centralized and decentralized), blockchain and its applications, social networks, etc.
        </p>

        <p>Before Rutgers, I was a postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu/">EconCS group</a> at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>, working with <a href="https://parkes.seas.harvard.edu/">David C. Parkes</a>. 
        In 2021, I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>, advised by <a href = "https://strategicreasoning.org/michael-p-wellman/">Michael P. Wellman</a>. I have worked as Ph.D. research intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/">Microsoft Research</a> and <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">J.P. Morgan AI Research</a>.

        <p><strong><i>My group at Rutgers is recruiting for 24' (<a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate/prospective-students/">application link</a>)! If you're interested in joining or working with our group, please take a look at <a href="join.html">this page</a>.</i></strong></p>

        <!-- <h3 class="title">Research Overview</h3 -->
<!--         <p><strong>Research Overview.</strong> Today's markets (e.g., economic platforms, recommender systems, financial markets and blockchains) are complex systems where algorithms interact with humans and other algorithms at an unprecedented complexity, speed, and scale.
        This raises the urgent question of modeling the behaviors that can be expected in such algorithmic markets for the design of effective multi-agent systems.
        Drawing on techniques from AI and machine learning, microeconomics, and optimization, I have focused on studying three interconnected components, centered around individual agents, the market designer, and normative considerations facing a "social planner" (who represents human values), towards a vision of constructing efficient and healthy economic systems.</p>

        </a></p> -->

<!--         Consider examples such as recommender systems, advertising technology, dynamic pricing algorithms used by online platforms, and smart contracts deployed on blockchains.

        My work aims to develop principled computational methods to understand strategic reasoning of rational agents and design mechanisms.
        I develop and apply methods from multi-agent system, machine learning, and algorithmic game theory to understand strategic reasoning of rational agents and design mechanisms. Some applications of my research include financial market and digital platform design. You can find my CV <a href="assets/cv/CV.pdf">here</a>.</p> -->

To this end, we develop a multi-agent Gym environment of a platform economy in a dynamic, multi-period setting, with the possible occurrence of economic shocks. Buyers and sellers are modeled as economically-motivated agents, choosing whether or not to pay corresponding fees to use the platform. We formulate the platform’s problem as a partially observable Markov decision process, and use deep reinforcement learning to model its fee setting and matching behavior. We consider two major types of regulation frameworks: (1) taxation policies and (2) platform fee restrictions, and offer extensive simulated experiments to characterize regulatory tradeoffs under optimal platform responses. Our results show that while many interventions are ineffective with a sophisticated platform actor, we identify a particular kind of regulation—fixing fees to optimal, pre-shock fees while still allowing a platform to choose how to match buyer demands to sellers—as promoting the efficiency, seller diversity, and resilience of the overall economic system.",

Amongst these, constant function market maker DEXs such as Uniswap handle the most volume of trades between ERC-20 tokens. With the introduction of Uniswap v3, liquidity providers can differentially allocate liquidity to trades that occur within specific price intervals. In this paper, we formalize the profit and loss that liquidity providers can earn when providing specific liquidity allocations to a v3 contract. We give a convex stochastic optimization problem for computing optimal liquidity allocation for a liquidity provider who holds a belief on how prices will evolve over time and use this to study the design question regarding how v3 contracts should partition the price space for permissible liquidity allocations. Our results show that making a greater diversity of price-space partitions available to a contract designer can simultaneously benefit both liquidity providers and traders.",

            "Financial options are contracts that specify the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a strike price by an expiration date. Standard exchanges offer options of predetermined strike values and trade options of different strikes independently, even for those written on the same underlying asset. Such independent market design can introduce arbitrage opportunities and lead to the thin market problem. The paper first proposes a mechanism that consolidates and matches orders on standard options related to the same underlying asset, while providing agents the flexibility to specify any custom strike value. The mechanism generalizes the classic double auction, runs in time polynomial to the number of orders, and poses no risk to the exchange, regardless of the value of the underlying asset at expiration. Empirical analysis on real-market options data shows that the mechanism can find new matches for options of different strike prices and reduce bid-ask spreads. Extending standard options written on a single asset, we propose and define a new derivative instrument -- combinatorial financial options that offer contract holders the right to buy or sell any linear combination of multiple underlying assets. We generalize our single-asset mechanism to match options written on different combinations of assets, and prove that optimal clearing of combinatorial financial options is coNP-hard. To facilitate market operations, we propose an algorithm that finds the exact optimal match through iterative constraint generation, and evaluate its performance on synthetically generated combinatorial options markets of different scales. As option prices reveal the market's collective belief of an underlying asset's future value, a combinatorial options market enables the expression of aggregate belief about future correlations among assets.",

Traders buy and sellinterval securities that pay $1 if the outcome falls into an interval and $0 otherwise. Our market takes the form of a centralautomated market maker and allows traders to express interval endpoints of arbitrary precision. We present two designs in both of which market operations take time logarithmic in the number of intervals (that traders distinguish), providing the first computationally efficient market for a continuous variable. Our first design replicates the popularlogarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), but operates exponentially faster than a standard LMSR by exploiting its modularity properties to construct a balanced binary tree and decompose computations along the tree nodes. The second design consists of two or more parallel LMSR market makers that mediate submarkets of increasingly fine-grained outcome partitions. This design remains computationally efficient for all operations, including arbitrage removal across submarkets. It adds two additional benefits for the market designer: (1) the ability to express utility for information at various resolutions by assigning different liquidity values, and (2) the ability to guarantee a true constant bounded loss by appropriately decreasing the liquidity in each submarket.",

            "We present an agent-based model of manipulating prices in financial markets through spoofing: submitting spurious orders to mislead traders who learn from the order book. Our model captures a complex market environment for a single security, whose common value is given by a dynamic fundamental time series. Agents trade through a limit-order book, based on their private values and noisy observations of the fundamental. We consider background agents following two types of trading strategies: the non-spoofable zero intelligence (ZI) that ignores the order book and the manipulable heuristic belief learning (HBL) that exploits the order book to predict price outcomes. We conduct empirical game-theoretic analysis upon simulated agent payoffs across parametrically different environments and measure the effect of spoofing on market performance in approximate strategic equilibria. We demonstrate that HBL traders can benefit price discovery and social welfare, but their existence in equilibrium renders a market vulnerable to manipulation: simple spoofing strategies can effectively mislead traders, distort prices and reduce total surplus. Based on this model, we propose to mitigate spoofing from two aspects: (1) mechanism design to disincentivize manipulation; and (2) trading strategy variations to improve the robustness of learning from market information. We evaluate the proposed approaches, taking into account potential strategic responses of agents, and characterize the conditions under which these approaches may deter manipulation and benefit market welfare. Our model provides a way to quantify the effect of spoofing on trading behavior and market efficiency, and thus it can help to evaluate the effectiveness of various market designs and trading strategies in mitigating an important form of market manipulation.",

The model includes three main parts: (1) a generator that learns to adapt original manipulation order streams to resemble trading patterns of a normal trader while preserving the manipulation intent; (2) a discriminator that differentiates the adversarially adapted manipulation order streams from normal trading activities; and (3) an agent-based simulator that evaluates the manipulation effect of adapted outputs. We conduct experiments on simulated order streams associated with a manipulator and a market-making agent respectively. We show examples of adapted manipulation order streams that mimic a specified market maker's quoting patterns and appear qualitatively different from the original manipulation strategy we implemented in the simulator. These results demonstrate the possibility of automatically generating a diverse set of (unseen) manipulation strategies that can facilitate the training of more robust detection algorithms.",

To reduce the vulnerability of learning traders to such manipulation, we propose two variations based on the standard heuristic belief learning (HBL) trading strategy, which learns transaction probabilities from market activities observed in an order book. The first variation selectively ignores orders at certain price levels, particularly where spoof orders are likely to be placed. The second considers the full order book, but adjusts its limit order price to correct for bias in decisions based on the learned heuristic beliefs. We employ agent-based simulation to evaluate these variations on two criteria: effectiveness in non-manipulated markets and robustness against manipulation. Background traders can adopt the (non-learning) zero intelligence strategies or HBL, in its basic form or the two variations. We conduct empirical game-theoretic analysis upon simulated payoffs to derive approximate strategic equilibria, and compare equilibrium outcomes across a variety of trading environments. Results show that agents can strategically make use of the option to block orders to improve robustness against spoofing, while retaining a comparable competitiveness in non-manipulated markets. Our second HBL variation exhibits a general improvement over standard HBL, in markets with and without manipulation. Further explorations suggest that traders can enjoy both improved profitability and robustness by combining the two proposed variations.",

We further show that a market with HBL traders is spoofable, in that a spoofer can qualitatively manipulate prices towards its desired direction. After re-equilibrating games with spoofing, we find spoofing generally hurts market surplus and decreases the proportion of HBL. However, HBL's persistence in most environments with spoofing indicates a consistently spoofable market.
